This is an assesment test project for [iPhone Photography School](https://iphonephotographyschool.com/). A tiny iOS application where users can pick a lesson from a list and watch it in the details view. 

# Introduction
The project developed by **`swift`** programing language, and is designed with both **`SwiftUI`** framework in the first page and **`UIKit`** for the detail page.

# Using
**Tools**
- ðŸ”¨Xcode IDE
- ðŸ”¨SPM (swift package manager) 

**Tech**
- ðŸ”¨UIKit
- ðŸ”¨SwiftUI
- ðŸ”¨Combine

**Architecture**
- ðŸ”¨Clean
- ðŸ”¨MVVM 

**3rd party**
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- [Realm database](https://github.com/realm/realm-swift)

# Features
Implemented based on **`clean`** architecture, and using **`MVVM`** design pattern for the scense. Using Alamofire for networking and Realm for data storage, all handled basically asynchronously. 
We needed a small database without any relation, so better to use "**Realm**" for better performance.

The project also contains repository for fetching images and videos, both remotely from server, and localy from database or file.
Using `AvPlayer` for displaying video.
